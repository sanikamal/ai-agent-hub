# Building AI Voice Agents for Production

This repo demonstrates how to design and deploy **real-time AI voice agents** for production use cases. Voice agents combine speech and reasoning capabilities to enable **natural, human-like conversations**, with applications across customer service, accessibility, healthcare, and interactive learning.

Using **LiveKit** for low-latency streaming, **RealAvatar** for avatar-driven interfaces, and **ElevenLabs** for custom voices, this project shows how to architect, optimize, and scale AI voice pipelines.

## Key Features

* **Core Voice Agent Pipeline**
  Integrates **Speech-to-Text (STT)**, **LLM reasoning**, and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** into a unified workflow.

* **Low-Latency Communication**
  Uses **WebRTC** and optimized networking from LiveKit to minimize delays compared to HTTP or WebSockets.

* **Interruptions & Turn-Taking**
  Incorporates **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**, **end-of-turn detection**, and **context management** to handle natural conversations.

* **Customizable Voices**
  Generate responses in different synthetic voices using RealAvatar + ElevenLabs.

* **Latency Optimization**
  Measure latency at each stage of the pipeline and apply strategies to balance **quality, speed, and cost**.

## Architecture Overview

A production-ready AI voice agent typically includes:

1. **Input Capture** — Audio streamed from user devices.
2. **Speech-to-Text (STT)** — Transcribe user speech into text.
3. **LLM Reasoning** — Generate structured, context-aware responses.
4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** — Convert agent responses into voice.
5. **Streaming & Networking** — Real-time communication via WebRTC.
6. **Latency Monitoring** — Metrics to track delays across the pipeline.

## Example Use Cases

* **Customer Support Agents** that converse in real time.
* **Healthcare Assistants** providing accessibility for patients.
* **Learning Companions** that tutor or coach using natural voice interaction.
* **AI Avatars** for interactive content and entertainment.
