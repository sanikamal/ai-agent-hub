|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Simple ReAct Agent from Scratch** | Build a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent from scratch, combining reasoning capabilities with action-oriented execution to solve tasks efficiently. | `ReAct`, `AI Agents`, `Python`,`OpenAI` | [Notebook](notebook/simple_react_agent_from_scratch.ipynb) |
| **LangGraph Components** | Explore the components of LangGraph and combine them to build flow-based applications for seamless execution and management of tasks. | `LangGraph`, `AI Agents`, `OpenAI` | [Notebook](notebook/langgraph_components.ipynb) |
| **Agentic Search** | Explore how agentic search retrieves multiple answers in a structured and predictable format, offering a streamlined alternative to traditional search engines that provide links. | `Agentic Search`, `AI Agents`, `LangGraph`, `Tavily` | [Notebook](notebook/agentic_search.ipynb) |
| **Persistence and Streaming** | Implementing persistence in agents to manage state across multiple threads, enable conversation switching, and reload previous states for continuity. | `State Management`, `Streaming`, `AI Agents`,`LangGraph` | [Notebook](notebook/persistence_and_streaming.ipynb) |
| **Human in the Loop** | Integrating human-in-the-loop mechanisms into agent systems to enhance decision-making, validate outputs, and ensure higher accuracy. | `Human-in-the-Loop`, `AI Agents`, `Decision Making`, `LangGraph` | [Notebook](notebook/human_in_the_loop.ipynb) |
| **LlamaIndex Router Query Engine** | Build a basic agentic RAG system by implementing a router that selects between query engines, such as Q&A or summarization, to execute queries over a single document. | `LlamaIndex`, `RAG`, `Query Engine` | [Notebook](notebook/llamaindex_router_query_engine.ipynb) |
